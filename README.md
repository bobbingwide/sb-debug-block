Debug point for a single block server side rendered block.

## Description
The Debug block plugin is a single block plugin to be used as the debug point for future Server Side Rendered blocks.

## Installation
The purpose of this plugin is to provide the source code for a Server Side Rendered block
that is copied into an existing plugin where the new SSR logic replaces an existing shortcode.

You should not need to activate this plugin. If you do, it's just like any other plugin.
